## Getting Started

First, install dependencies with :

```bash
npm install
```
then, run the server with :

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the test request.

You can start editing the page by modifying `index.js`. The Api routes auto-updates as you edit the file.
